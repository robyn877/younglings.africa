                <h1>My Goals and Obectives</h1><br>
                <p class="bio">As a young individaul I have many goals and aspirations for myself.My goal in life is to  reach the maximim of atleast  
                    three degrees.That would be a degree in Technology,Teaching and Socail working.I chose these three degrees because in all 3 
                    three of them I can help others  better their lives.As I grew up all i wanted to do was to always make a difference in my own 
                    life and in the lives of others.In order to reach this goals I know that i need to work exceptionally well.I need to start by getting
                    the small things right because yet its the small things that can change our lives.At the age of 35 I should have reached my goal .
                    But yet that would not be enough for me but i will be able to  choose between three degrees what i really love doing.I know i 
                    will be able to accomplish all of my goals by working exceptionally well staying motivated and humble.
                    I have a my own road map set up to make sure I get pass all my goals.This helps me stay on the road of persuing all of my goals</p
